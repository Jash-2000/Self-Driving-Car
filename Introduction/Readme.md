## Sensors 

A sensor is any device that measures or detects some property of the environment, or changes to that property over time. Sensors are broadly categorized into two types, depending 
on what property they record. If they record a property of the environment they are **exteroceptive**. Extero means outside, or from the surroundings. On the other hand, if the 
sensors record a property of the ego vehicle, they are **proprioceptive**. Proprios means internal, or one's own.

Some of the main sensors used for perception of a car:
 1. Camera
 2. Lidar
 3. Radar
 4. Ultrasonic
 5. GPS
 6. IMU
 7. Wheel Odometry
